We modified what gets generated in the symbol table. 
It used to contain only the variables used in the program, now it also contains function names and the different in the program.
Assume for example we have a function "sum" that has two integer local variables x, and y; and the function main that has a
character local variable s.
Then the symbol table would look like this: 
%sum
entier x
entier y
%Main
car s

Any variables or constants declared/defined in the global scope are written at the top of the symbol table before other scopes.

N.B., the modifications have been done directly to the lexer.java file that was generated when compiling lexer using JLex.

We also mentioned this modification in the lexer documentation
